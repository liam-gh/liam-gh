*Hello, I'm Liam! Welcome to my GitHub profile.*

In September 2025, I'll be studying a degree in BSc Computer Science, where I hope to learn to build cool projects from the ground up. 
In preperation for my studies, I am actively learning the fundamentals of many programming languages, notably, JavaScript & Python.
I'm hoping to produce 2-3 working projects on here before I start my degree in September.

I have tried my hand at many different creative disciplines during my time as a freelance graphic designer / digital artist, and my time spent in college, where I earned a distinction grade in my UAL Level 3 Diploma in Creative Digital Media & Technology, and a distinction in my UAL level 2 Diploma in Art & Design. I have experience creating games, curating and producing short films, digital illustration, graphic design and 3D modelling - to name a few. Now - I am looking for the next thing to scratch that itch...

The thing I love about programming is you get what you put in, figuratively and quite literally. You have full control on what you create and the possibilities are truly endless. In 6 months time, I'm hoping to have good knowledge in computer science theory, language fundamentals and a strong approach to problem solving as this'll set me up nicely for my degree.


TL;DR: I want to build cool projects and have fun :)
